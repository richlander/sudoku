# Sudoku puzzle solver

This project is intended to solve relatively simple Sudoku puzzles using well understood logical strategies. Given a correctly defined Sudoku puzzle, these strategies always produce valid results.

The project is inspired by [SudokuWiki.org](). It is an excellent resource for anyone working with Sudoku puzzles.

The project implements most of the basic [strategies](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Strategy_Families). It also implements the more difficult X-Wing strategy. The project may be expanded over time, however, the primary motivation of the project has been to explore various C# features.
